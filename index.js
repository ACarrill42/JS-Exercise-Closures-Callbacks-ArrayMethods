/**
 * ### Challenge `processFirstItem`
 * 
 * @instructions
 * Implement a higher-order function called `processFirstItem`.
 * It takes two arguments:
 * @param stringList an array of strings.
 * @param callback function that takes a string as its argument.
 * @returns the result of invoking `callback` with the FIRST element in `stringList`.
 * 
 * Example of usage of this higher-order function:
 * Invoking `processFirstItem` passing `['foo', 'bar']` and `(str) => str + str`,
 * should return 'foofoo'.

/**
Task 2: Your final task is to create a function called `counterMakerWithLimit` that accepts the following parameters: 

(1) Callback function `get inning score`


and returns 

1st inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
2nd inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
3rd inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
4th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
5th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
6th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
7th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
8th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
9th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam

Final Score: awayTeam - homeTeam


  
 * Implement a counter maker that takes a max value for the count.
 * A counter created with it will reset itself after reaching the max value.
 * Usage is as follows:
 * 
 * const counter = counterMakerWithLimit(3)
 * counter() // should return 0
 * counter() // should return 1
 * counter() // should return 2
 * counter() // should return 3
 * counter() // should return 0
 * counter() // should return 1
 * counter() // should return 2
 * counter() // should return 3
 * counter() // should return 0
 * etc
